## Project Architecture

### Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React 18 + Vite 5
- **Backend**: Express + Socket.IO (WebSockets)
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS with Radix UI components
- **Language**: JavaScript (ES Modules)

## Development Setup

### Ports
- **Frontend (Development)**: Port 5000 (Vite dev server)
- **Backend (Development)**: Port 8080 (Express + Socket.IO)

### Running in Replit
The project has TWO workflows configured:
1. **Frontend**: Runs Vite dev server on port 5000 with proxy to backend
2. **Backend**: Runs Express server on port 8080 (required for Daily Challenge database integration)

### Key Configurations
- Vite is configured to bind to `0.0.0.0:5000` to work with Replit's proxy
- Backend proxy is configured in `vite.config.js` to forward `/api`, `/socket.io`, and `/health` to `localhost:8080`
- All game modes (Duel, Battle Royale, Shared, Daily Challenge) use the local backend for development

## Game Modes

1. **Duel (1v1)**: Each player sets a secret word for the other; 6 guesses; winner by solve/steps
2. **Battle Royale**: Host sets one word; 2+ players guess; first correct wins
3. **Shared Duel**: Players share a common word challenge
4. **Daily Challenge**: Single-player daily puzzle with deterministic word generation; same word for all players each day; progress tracked via session cookies; 6 guesses max; victory modal on completion

## Recent Changes

### October 20, 2025 - Comprehensive Error Handling System
- **ErrorNotificationProvider Context**: Centralized error management system for entire application
  - Created `ErrorNotificationContext.jsx` with severity levels (error, warning, info, success)
  - Provides `showNotification()`, `dismissNotification()`, and `clearNotifications()` methods
  - Auto-dismisses notifications after 1.5 seconds to prevent clutter
  - Supports notification stacking for multiple simultaneous messages

  - Severity-based styling: red (error), yellow (warning), blue (info), green (success)
  - Absolutely positioned to prevent layout shifts
  - Smooth fade-in/fade-out animations
  - Mobile-friendly with 48px minimum touch targets
  - ARIA labels and screen reader support
  
- **Socket.IO Connection Integration**: Automatic connection status feedback
  - Updated `useSocketConnection` hook to show notifications on:
    - Disconnect: Yellow "Connection lost - Reconnecting..." warning
    - Reconnect: Green "Reconnected to server" success message
    - Connection Error: Red "Connection error - Please check your network" error
  - Prevents duplicate notifications using refs
  - Maintains backward compatibility with ConnectionBar component

  - **Touch targets**: 48×48px minimum for all interactive elements (buttons, inputs, keyboard keys)
  - **Spacing**: 8px minimum between all interactive elements (keyboard keys, buttons)
  - **Safe areas**: iPhone notches and Android cutouts fully supported with viewport-fit=cover
  
- **Keyboard Improvements**:
  - Increased key height from 44px to 48px on mobile
  - Improved spacing: 8px between keys (horizontal and vertical)
  - Added touch-manipulation to prevent double-tap zoom

### October 20, 2025 - Render Deployment & User Persistence Fixes
- **Backend Deployment Fix**: Updated `server/package.json` for Render compatibility
  - Added missing dependencies: `@prisma/client`, `cookie-parser`, `luxon`, `prisma`
  - Added `postinstall` script to auto-generate Prisma client on deployment
  - Schema path configured with fallback: `prisma generate --schema=../prisma/schema.prisma || prisma generate`
  - Fixed ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND error for cookie-parser on Render
  
- **User Persistence Fix**: Switched from cookie-based to localStorage-based user tracking
  - Cookies don't work in Replit iframe due to sameSite restrictions
  - Frontend generates UUID on first visit → stores in localStorage
  - Backend receives UUID via `X-User-Id` header → creates User record with that UUID
  - Backend now always ensures User exists in database before saving guesses
  - Fixed foreign key constraint violation (DailyResult_userId_fkey)
  - Fixed "each request creates new user" bug - guesses now accumulate correctly
  
- **Frontend Deployment**: Vercel configuration
  - Frontend hosted on Vercel (client folder only)
  - Added `vercel.json` with rewrites to forward `/api/*`, `/socket.io/*`, and `/health` to Render backend
  - Backend remains on Render with DATABASE_URL configured

- **Error Display**: Updated Daily Challenge status messages to show errors in red (matching other modes)

  - Persistent keyboard footer for better UX
  - **Correct word display**: When player loses, the correct word is displayed above the board
- **Gameplay Consistency**: Core gameplay matches other modes
  - Press ENTER key to submit guess (no auto-submit)
  - Board provides feedback for invalid guesses (wrong length, invalid word)
  - Backend returns correct word when game ends
- **Critical Bug Fix**: Fixed "Invalid response from server" error
  - Updated Vite proxy configuration to point to local backend (localhost:8080)
